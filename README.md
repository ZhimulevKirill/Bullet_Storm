# Bullet_Storm
A simple bullet-hell game, made on python 3.7.2
I used some special python libraries, like shapely. All of them are in Requirements file in the last version commit.

Bullet-Hell is a genre of games, where you play as a character with small hitbox and are trying to dodge 
lots of bullets flying right into your face.

I think that sill there's some unknown bugs, so if this thing crashes, you will be alarmed.
